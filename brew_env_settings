# NOTE! This may be system/brew version specific!

## PYTHON3 (macOS comes with Python 2)
# Python has been installed as

#export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib"
#export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/openssl/include"

#export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib/pkgconfig"


## CURL (macOS comes with a version)

# If you need to have curl first in your PATH run:
#export PATH="/usr/local/opt/curl/bin:$PATH"
# For compilers to find curl you may need to set:
#export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/curl/lib"
#export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/curl/include"
# For pkg-config to find curl you may need to set:
#export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/opt/curl/lib/pkgconfig"


## LLVM (macOS comes with a version)

# If you need to have llvm first in your PATH run:
#export PATH="/usr/local/opt/llvm/bin:$PATH"
# For compilers to find llvm you may need to set:
#export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/llvm/lib"
#export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/llvm/include"
# To use the bundled libc++ please add the following LDFLAGS:
#export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/llvm/lib -Wl,-rpath,/usr/local/opt/llvm/lib"


## SQLITE3 (MacOs comes with older version)

# If you need to have sqlite first in your PATH run:
#export PATH="/usr/local/opt/sqlite/bin:$PATH"
# For compilers to find sqlite you may need to set:
#export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/sqlite/lib"
#export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/sqlite/include"
# For pkg-config to find sqlite you may need to set:
#export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/opt/sqlite/lib/pkgconfig"


## TCL-TK (MacOs comes with older version)

# If you need to have tcl-tk first in your PATH run:
#export PATH="/usr/local/opt/tcl-tk/bin:$PATH"
# For compilers to find tcl-tk you may need to set:
#export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/tcl-tk/lib"
#export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/tcl-tk/include"
# For pkg-config to find tcl-tk you may need to set:

# READLINE (macOS provides the BSD libedit library)

# For compilers to find readline you may need to set:
#export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/readline/lib"

# For pkg-config to find readline you may need to set:
#export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/opt/readline/lib/pkgconfig"


## NSS (macOS comes with a version, and Firefox has problems with Brew version)

# If you need to have nss first in your PATH run:
#export PATH="/usr/local/opt/nss/bin:$PATH"
# For compilers to find nss you may need to set:
#export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/nss/lib"
